# GavProtect (Gavin Protect)
GavProtect is a public fork of Grim, offering additional cloud based features, systems, and etc.

## Improved/Added Features
### Additional Cloud Checks
I have decided to make a backend specifically for this project. It will handle some of the more resource using checks, as well as ones I would like to keep private for the time being. Here are some examples of the checks that will be implemented:

- Combat Analysis Checks (Aim Assist, Auto Clicker, Auto Block, Kill Aura, etc.)

Also please dont send ddos attacks to my laptop, thanks!

### Unique Mitigation System
GavProtect will also have customizable settings for mitigations. These mitigations will depend on how often someone flags, or how severe a flag is. Here are the types of mitigations going to be implemented:

- Combat Hit Slowdown (Slows down a players hit rate by applying a cooldown)

- Combat Damage Cancellation (Prevents a player from doing damage, but still deals knockback and server applies a dake damagae animation)

- Combat Hit Cancellation (Cancels attacks)

- Movement Default Setbacks (What Grim uses by default)

- Movement Pulldown Setbacks (Similar to Polar, this pulls down a player based on the last legitimate position)
